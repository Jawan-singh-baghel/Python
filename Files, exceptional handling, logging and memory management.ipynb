    "\n",
    "# Memory Leaks\n",
    "# What happens: Objects that are no longer needed are not released because they are still referenced (often unintentionally).\n",
    "# Example: Circular references or global variables that aren’t cleared.\n",
    "# Impact: Increased memory usage over time, especially in long-running programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Circular References\n",
    "# What happens: Two or more objects reference each other, preventing their memory from being released by simple reference counting.\n",
    "# Solution: Python's garbage collector can detect these, but not always immediately or efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High Memory Usage with Large Data\n",
    "# What happens: Handling large datasets (e.g., big lists, images, or files) can consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "# Impact: Slows down the application or causes it to crash if memory is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Memory Fragmentation\n",
    "# What happens: Frequent allocation and deallocation of small memory blocks can lead to fragmentation.\n",
    "# Impact: Reduces the efficient use of memory over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limited Control Over Memory\n",
    "# What happens: Python hides many low-level memory operations from the developer.\n",
    "# Impact: Makes it harder to optimize memory use in performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Garbage Collection Overhead\n",
    "# What happens: The garbage collector runs automatically but can interrupt execution.\n",
